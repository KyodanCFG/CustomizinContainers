## Info

- By default, this mod changes the following:
    * Two pockets will be `2` units tall
    * Junk Box will be `12x16` units (easier to see inventory)
    * Mag Case will be `6x8` units 
    * Weapons Case will be `6x10` units 
    * Item restrictions in backpacks and secure cases will be `ON`

## Installation

1. Extract archive to your `server folder/user/mods` folder 
    * Folder structure should look like `server folder/user/mods/Kyodan-CustomizinContainers-X.X.X`
2. Close your server (if it's running)
3. Edit `settings.json` in your preferred text editor/IDE, review/modify any settings, then save and close
4. Delete your `server folder/user/cache` folder
5. Run your server (it should generate a new cache)

* If you change a setting in `settings.json`, repeat steps 2-5 above
* `settings_default.json` is a backup file that contains default container settings from Live

## Settings

- Below are the flags for each setting:
    * `customizinContainers` (true|false)       - determines if this script is enabled/disabled
    * `removeRestrictions` (true|false)         - determines if restrictions are removed from secure cases
    * `width` (number)                          - determines how many units wide the container will be
                                                (recommend to set less than 28)
    * `height` (number)                         - determines how many units tall the container will be
                                                (recommend to set less than 16)
